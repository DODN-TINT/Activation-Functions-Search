# Activation-Functions-Search
This is code for the article [over at ML From Scratch](https://mlfromscratch.com/activation-functions-explained/) on activation functions.
I modified the original as presented by the original author (Casper Hansen) as follows:

1. Use of TensorBoard in comparing performance, accuracy and loss 
2. Added some visualization on the sample MNIST data (might help some beginners who will look into these later)
3. Corrected minor errors e.g. use of Categorical_CrossEntropy as loss instead of Binary_CrossEntropy function
   in the example.
4. TO DO: other datasets e.g. CIFAR-100
